I am now 100% clear on your goal:
Frontend Code: Lives on GitHub.
Live Frontend App: Served to users from GitHub Pages.
Secret API Key: Stored safely on Render.
The Connection: The GitHub Pages app will talk to a secure service on Render, which will then talk to Google. Your key will never be public.
This is a standard and secure architecture. The way to achieve it is by creating a small proxy server that runs on Render. I will provide the exact code to do this. We will modify your React project to talk to this new server instead of directly to Google.
